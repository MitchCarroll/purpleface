# purpleface
The purpleface programming language

_Proposed Features:_
- Function Inference
define function: a, b to c as -
- "map c to (a * b)", where a > 0, and a,b,c are integers.

define function: s to none as "print s", where s is string, and none is null.

process c as s, with 5 as a, and 4 as b.

==> 20
